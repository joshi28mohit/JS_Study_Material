// API - Application Package/Programming Interface.

// E.g - If a good coder has made a mailing service and he wants it to be used by outer world/other developers 
// but we dont know how many expected i/p are there for using the service

// So, the developer will export a contract (which should be compulsariliy fulfilled )with the facilities of:
// how to access the service?
// i/p to give for using the service.
// o/p to expect.


// API Helps us to use their facilities either by paid medium or free(like Co-Win).
