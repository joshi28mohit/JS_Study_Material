// npm init creates th package.json file

// With npm, we can use third party modules too like the axios for network calls.

// npm i axios -> will install axios package in our folder along with all the libraries on which axios is dependent on 
// When we push our code on github, we dont do so along with the node_modules folder as the size is very large, we simply focus on package_lock.json
// the other person will type->
// npm i and this will install all the packages and the libraries on which the axios is dependent. So, the same versions of all the dependencies will be installed.


// package-lock.json willl help us to get the versions and names of dependencies required.
// we use gitignore for it



// Streams - Handles data flowing.
